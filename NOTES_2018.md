# Notes for solving 2018
## Day 01: Chronal Calibration

Again, first day is nothing to write home about: just iterate and sum, nothing too complicated.

## Day 02: Inventory Management System

Oh look, another of those "loop over EVERY-FUCKING-COMBINATION" exercises...

## Day 03: No Matter How You Slice It

Not much we haven't seen last year.

## Day 04: Repose Record

There's something about this "find the most used record" type of exercises that I dislike.
