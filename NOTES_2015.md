First day wasn't very complicated. I chose to use `i16` out of pragmatic reasons, I don't believe Santa would go this high or this low.

I've added [a benchmark](benches/year_2015_day_01.rs) for this day. ~~The first version had me naively reusing Ruby functionalities, when given Rust's ease of navigating memory, it was faster to just iterate through the data.~~

There is an EVEN BIGGER optimization that can be done if you treat your string as a bunch of u16 instead of u8.

I used an object-like approach on this one. Using `(&self)` as he first argument wasn't too much of a stretch since [that's exactly how Ruby handles its Object-Oriented pattern in its C code](https://silverhammermba.github.io/emberb/c/#Methods).

I'm not sure yet whether `impl FromStr for PresentBox` was useful or whether I could have just made my own custom method, but I had fun trying it out. I also like the separation between `struct` and `impl`, very neat for converting from/to other C-like languages.

The most annoying part here is dealing with many integers size. Clearly everything here is `unsigned`, but while I'm sure my box dimensions all fit within `u8(0..255)`, the second I multiply them, I get into `u16(0..65_535)` range, and when I reach the results, I'm clearly overflowing up to `u32(0..4_294_967_295)` size. I would love to have each level work nicely with each other, but no, I have to manually cast.

Again, remember to clone your references before modifying, and everything will work out nicely.

This time, [the benchmark](benches/year_2015_day_03.rs) checks which of [`BTreeSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/struct.BTreeSet.html) or [`HashSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/hash_set/struct.HashSet.html) is faster. Funnily enough, while `HashSet` is faster at querying elements, it seems `BTreeSet` is [faster at removing them](https://github.com/ssomers/rust_bench_sets_compared). In our case, we only need to insert, so we can safely go with `HashSet`.

Another [benchmark](benches/year_2015_day_05.rs), and again it's about the performance of [`.contains()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.contains). Using [`.try_fold()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.try_fold) to return ASAP when any element doesn't satisfy our needs is also a nice touch.

I started doing a copy of my original "naive" algorithm, and as it was too slow, I decided to learn [how to pass closures in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-01-closures.html).

This one was already complicated in Ruby, but it gets even worse when you have to deal with [Rust's lifetimes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html). The concept in itself is kinda okay to understand, but the way it has to be used sometimes makes no sense. I guess I'll get used to it with time. A [nice crate](https://docs.rs/advent-of-code/2022.0.66/src/advent_of_code/year2015/day07.rs.html) helped me see through it a bit more clearly.

This one got me a bit closer to understand how lifetimes function.

While my [more experienced counterpart](https://docs.rs/advent-of-code/2022.0.66/src/advent_of_code/year2015/day09.rs.html) used a cleaner perform-all-permutations approach, I wanted to keep the recursivity of my original algorithm, if only to force myself to make lifetimes work across recursion.

Why do these people even bother having a Christmas dinner together if they hate each other (and us) so much? On the Rust front, beginning to understand ownership a little better, I managed to write this one without resorting to lifetimes. Just makes everything more readable.

Something I also gained over my Ruby implementation is saving a loop: since we are looping back to our initial point at the end of each cycle, a permutation like `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` will have the same value as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 0]`. Therefore, we only need to generate (brute-force?) sequences starting with our first element. Once we reach our first depth, we can iterate over all available results.

If you want to dig, you can think of each reindeer as a [finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), which is [one of the concepts that are best solved thanks to Object-oriented programming](https://eev.ee/blog/2013/03/03/the-controller-pattern-is-awful-and-other-oo-heresy/).

</details>

This one was much harder.

After trying many times to use my previous algorithm to mark ranges where numbers were "forbidden", things got heated, and in the end, I reworked something myself by [following a proper implementation](https://docs.rs/advent-of-code/2022.0.66/src/advent_of_code/year2015/day15.rs.html). However, being in Rust makes the execution of all these loops way faster than it used to be in Ruby.

Heh, I'm getting to used to this stuff that it compiled on the second try, and passed the tests on the second. Reworking my Ruby algorithm into Ruby wasn't complicated either.

That was fun.

My [distinguished competitor](https://docs.rs/advent-of-code/2022.0.66/src/advent_of_code/year2015/day18.rs.html) used a single-dimensional vector approach, which may have a better performance, but quite frankly, I prefer having representation closer to "physical" reality. But it's just me, don't listen to me too much.

I remembered this one was A PIECE OF SHIT to run in Ruby, as it lasted around over minute on my machine the last time I ran it. Having it run in only one second here is a real pleasure. Some issues flip-flapping between types, but nothing too brutal.

In that occasion, rewriting my code made it unworkable, no matter how many times I tried, and I must have made the same input mistake many times because my second day results were always off by twenty, even when [carefully copying an algorithm that works](https://github.com/rHermes/adventofcode/blob/master/2015/22/y2015_d22_p02.py).
