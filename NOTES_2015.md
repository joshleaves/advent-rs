First day wasn't very complicated. I chose to use `i16` out of pragmatic reasons, I don't believe Santa would go this high or this low.

I've added [a benchmark](benches/year_2015_day_01.rs) for this day. ~~The first version had me naively reusing Ruby functionalities, when given Rust's ease of navigating memory, it was faster to just iterate through the data.~~

There is an EVEN BIGGER optimization that can be done if you treat your string as a bunch of u16 instead of u8.

I used an object-like approach on this one. Using `(&self)` as he first argument wasn't too much of a stretch since [that's exactly how Ruby handles its Object-Oriented pattern in its C code](https://silverhammermba.github.io/emberb/c/#Methods).

I'm not sure yet whether `impl FromStr for PresentBox` was useful or whether I could have just made my own custom method, but I had fun trying it out. I also like the separation between `struct` and `impl`, very neat for converting from/to other C-like languages.

The most annoying part here is dealing with many integers size. Clearly everything here is `unsigned`, but while I'm sure my box dimensions all fit within `u8(0..255)`, the second I multiply them, I get into `u16(0..65_535)` range, and when I reach the results, I'm clearly overflowing up to `u32(0..4_294_967_295)` size. I would love to have each level work nicely with each other, but no, I have to manually cast.

Again, remember to clone your references before modifying, and everything will work out nicely.

This time, [the benchmark](benches/year_2015_day_03.rs) checks which of [`BTreeSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/struct.BTreeSet.html) or [`HashSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/hash_set/struct.HashSet.html) is faster. Funnily enough, while `HashSet` is faster at querying elements, it seems `BTreeSet` is [faster at removing them](https://github.com/ssomers/rust_bench_sets_compared). In our case, we only need to insert, so we can safely go with `HashSet`.

Another [benchmark](benches/year_2015_day_05.rs), and again it's about the performance of [`.contains()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.contains). Using [`.try_fold()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.try_fold) to return ASAP when any element doesn't satisfy our needs is also a nice touch.

I started doing a copy of my original "naive" algorithm, and as it was too slow, I decided to learn [how to pass closures in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-01-closures.html).

This one was already complicated in Ruby, but it gets even worse when you have to deal with [Rust's lifetimes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html). The concept in itself is kinda okay to understand, but the way it has to be used sometimes makes no sense. I guess I'll get used to it with time. A [nice crate](https://docs.rs/advent-of-code/2022.0.66/src/advent_of_code/year2015/day07.rs.html) helped me see through it a bit more clearly.

This one got me a bit closer to understand how lifetimes function.

While my [more experienced counterpart](https://docs.rs/advent-of-code/2022.0.66/src/advent_of_code/year2015/day09.rs.html) used a cleaner perform-all-permutations approach, I wanted to keep the recursivity of my original algorithm, if only to force myself to make lifetimes work across recursion.

Why do these people even bother having a Christmas dinner together if they hate each other (and us) so much? On the Rust front, beginning to understand ownership a little better, I managed to write this one without resorting to lifetimes. Just makes everything more readable.

Something I also gained over my Ruby implementation is saving a loop: since we are looping back to our initial point at the end of each cycle, a permutation like `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` will have the same value as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 0]`. Therefore, we only need to generate (brute-force?) sequences starting with our first element. Once we reach our first depth, we can iterate over all available results.
