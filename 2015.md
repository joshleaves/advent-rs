First day wasn't very complicated. I chose to use `i16` out of pragmatic reasons, I don't believe Santa would go this high or this low.

I've added [a benchmark](benches/year_2015_day_01.rs) for this day. The first version had me naively reusing Ruby functionalities, when given Rust's ease of navigating memory, it was faster to just iterate through the data.

## Day 02: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

```
test year_2015::day_02::tests::works_with_samples_v1 ... ok
test year_2015::day_02::tests::works_with_samples_v2 ... ok
test year_2015_day_02 ... ok

year_2015::day_02/year_2015::day_02_v1
                        time:   [74.716 µs 74.839 µs 74.945 µs]
year_2015::day_02/year_2015::day_02_v2
                        time:   [74.636 µs 74.685 µs 74.727 µs]
```

I used an object-like approach on this one. Using `(&self)` as he first argument wasn't too much of a stretch since [that's exactly how Ruby handles its Object-Oriented pattern in its C code](https://silverhammermba.github.io/emberb/c/#Methods).

I'm not sure yet whether `impl FromStr for PresentBox` was useful or whether I could have just made my own custom method, but I had fun trying it out. I also like the separation between `struct` and `impl`, very neat for converting from/to other C-like languages.

The most annoying part here is dealing with many integers size. Clearly everything here is `unsigned`, but while I'm sure my box dimensions all fit within `u8(0..255)`, the second I multiply them, I get into `u16(0..65_535)` range, and when I reach the results, I'm clearly overflowing up to `u32(0..4_294_967_295)` size. I would love to have each level work nicely with each other, but no, I have to manually cast.

## Day 03: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum

```

test year_2015::day_03::tests::works_with_samples_v1 ... ok
test year_2015::day_03::tests::works_with_samples_v2 ... ok
test year_2015_day_03 ... ok

year_2015::day_03/year_2015::day_03_v1
                        time:   [415.91 µs 416.24 µs 416.60 µs]

                        time:   [440.35 µs 441.72 µs 442.91 µs]

year_2015::day_03_v1/BTreeSet/8192
                        time:   [410.11 µs 411.30 µs 413.11 µs]
year_2015::day_03_v1/HashSet/8192
                        time:   [169.64 µs 169.95 µs 170.28 µs]
year_2015::day_03_v2/BTreeSet/8192
                        time:   [440.56 µs 441.85 µs 443.34 µs]

                        time:   [179.96 µs 180.06 µs 180.15 µs]
```

Again, remember to clone your references before modifying, and everything will work out nicely.

This time, [the benchmark](benches/year_2015_day_03.rs) checks which of [`BTreeSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/struct.BTreeSet.html) or [`HashSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/hash_set/struct.HashSet.html) is faster. Funnily enough, while `HashSet` is faster at querying elements, it seems `BTreeSet` is [faster at removing them](https://github.com/ssomers/rust_bench_sets_compared). In our case, we only need to insert, so we can safely go with `HashSet`.

## Day 04:The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

```
test year_2015::day_04::tests::works_with_samples_v1 ... ignored
test year_2015::day_04::tests::works_with_samples_v2 ... ignored
test year_2015_day_04 ... ok

year_2015::day_04/year_2015::day_04_v1
                        time:   [65.402 ms 65.534 ms 65.640 ms]
Warning: Unable to complete 10 samples in 5.0s. You may wish to increase target time to 18.9s.
year_2015::day_04/year_2015::day_04_v2
                        time:   [1.8911 s 1.8941 s 1.8969 s]
```

Of course, the bastard child had to be annoying, no matter what language we are in. We can actually win A BIT of time here, but we have to fiddle with bytes.

## Day 05: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?

```
test year_2015::day_05::tests::finds_nice_strings_v1 ... ok
test year_2015::day_05::tests::finds_nice_strings_v2 ... ok
test year_2015::day_05::tests::works_with_samples_v1 ... ok
test year_2015::day_05::tests::works_with_samples_v2 ... ok
test year_2015_day_05 ... ok

year_2015::day_05/year_2015::day_05_v1
                        time:   [142.32 µs 142.58 µs 142.91 µs]
year_2015::day_05/year_2015::day_05_v2
                        time:   [299.92 µs 300.33 µs 300.68 µs]
```

Another [benchmark](benches/year_2015_day_05.rs), and again it's about the performance of [`.contains()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.contains). Using [`.try_fold()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.try_fold) to return ASAP when any element doesn't satisfy our needs is also a nice touch.
